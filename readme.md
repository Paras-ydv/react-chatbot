## üí° Usage (Interacting with the Bot)

The chatbot initializes with a welcome message.

1.  **Type your message** into the input field at the bottom of the chat window.
2.  **Press the "Send" button** or the **`Enter`** key.
3.  The user message will appear, and after a short delay (simulating processing time), the bot's response will be displayed.

### Example Keyword-Based Conversation:

| User Input | Bot Response (Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hello` | `Hello! How can I assist you?` |
| `tell me about your features` | `I am not sure how to respond to that. Please try a different question.` |
| `bye` | `Goodbye! Have a great day!` |
